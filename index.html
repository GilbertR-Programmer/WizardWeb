        <p>The group is exploring a dank cave searching for a magic goblin ruby as part of a longer journey.</p>

        <h1>In play</h1>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace (Running game):</b> The cave is dark and damp, with the sound of dripping water echoing through the tunnels. You can barely make out the path ahead, but you can see a glint deeper in the cave. What do you do?</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Sally (Playing Eric):</b> We can't see, I'm going to cast conjure flame.</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace:</b> Ok great please roll your d4 to see which spell you cast.</p>

        <p class="left"><b>*Sally rolls 1d4 and gets a 3*</b></p>

        <p class="left"><b>Sally:</b> That's create light.</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace:</b> You fill the cave with bright light and can now see clearly the goblin ruby, along with three armed goblins guarding it. What do you do?</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Dave (Playing Sam):</b> I cast a spell at the goblins!</p>

        <p class="left"><b>*Dave rolls 1d4 and gets a 1*</b></p>

        <p class="left"><b>Dave:</b> That's levitate, what happens?</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace:</b> The goblins begin to levitate</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Dave:</b> I run under them and grab the ruby</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace:</b> Excellent. You grab the ruby, but catch a spear to the back from on of the above goblins.</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Dave:</b> Damn I've taken three already, one more and i die.</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace:</b> I have to save Sam, I cast a spell at the goblins</p>

        <p class="left"><b>*Sam rolls 1d4 and gets a 1*</b></p>

        <p class="left"><b>Sam:</b> That's conjure goblin, what happens?</p>

        <p class="left"><b>Grace:</b> Now there are four goblins guarding the ruby, one standing next to Sam.</p>

        <h1>We jump ahead to the end of the session</h1>

        <p class="centre">Here the players have a conversation about the game. They decide they need to be able to heal when they rest and cast spells better.</p>
        <h1>They add the following rules</h1>
